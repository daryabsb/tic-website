                    <p>NDT plays a crucial role in everyday life for companies using pipelines, refineries, civil structures, oil and gas platforms, power stations, marine and many more.</p>
                    <p>NDT helps support and protect your investment made in infrastructure, by providing the valuable data needed to detect, monitor, and improve processes and assessments, as well as looking to extend the life of equipment.</p>
                    <p>The goal of NDT is to ensure that critical infrastructure is properly maintained in order to avoid catastrophic accidents and failures which can also have devastating impact and disruptions, where some companies may never recover. NDT also allows you to meet and comply with industry and government regulations and requirements.</p>
                    <p>In the event of undetected flaws and defects, repairs and replacements can be expensive and risk the safety and conditions of your company employees, general public and can result to a loss of revenue, and company reputation in the event of unplanned shutdown or delays due to equipment failure.</p>

                      <p>Steel manufacturing and fabrication is an important trade catering to almost all industrial sectors. Steel products are essential to industries such as transportation, construction, energy, agriculture, mining, and consumer goods manufacturing.</p>
                      <p><strong>Steel Fabrication</strong> is the process of creating steel products through metal manufacturing processes, manipulation of parts to make machines and structures. Examples of these processes are cutting, bending, and joining. Additional processes include finishing and heat treatment as well as additional characteristics to the metal product.</p>
                      <p><strong>Steel Manufacturing</strong> it is the process that raw materials go through before they become the final product to be sold to consumers. The role of the manufacture is the practice of putting raw materials through a process to create a finished product or part.</p>
                      <p>The Non-Destructive Testing techniques are used for detecting and evaluate defects and during manufacture and fabrication as well as the defects developed during service of the steel components. Such methods are a group of analysis techniques used for evaluating the properties of steel materials, components, or welds without causing any damage to them.</p>

                      <p>The role of a chemical testing laboratory is to determine how well a product performs the job that it’s designed to do, and how long it will last with normal usage.
