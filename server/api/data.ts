                      <p><strong>Steel Fabrication</strong> is the process of creating steel products through metal manufacturing processes, manipulation of parts to make machines and structures. Examples of these processes are cutting, bending, and joining. Additional processes include finishing and heat treatment as well as additional characteristics to the metal product.</p>
                      <p><strong>Steel Manufacturing</strong> it is the process that raw materials go through before they become the final product to be sold to consumers. The role of the manufacture is the practice of putting raw materials through a process to create a finished product or part.</p>
                      <p>The Non-Destructive Testing techniques are used for detecting and evaluate defects and during manufacture and fabrication as well as the defects developed during service of the steel components. Such methods are a group of analysis techniques used for evaluating the properties of steel materials, components, or welds without causing any damage to them.</p>
